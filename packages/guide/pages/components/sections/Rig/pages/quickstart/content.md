### What's in it? Folders...

> - bin/
> - config/
> - locales/
> - project-files/
> - **src/**

- `bin`: Admin scripts that do one-off tasks like resize images and check metadata files.
- `config`: Admin scripts that configure the page builder, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
- `locales`: Folders for each locale that contain the text content of your page. This is where you'll want to write most of your content so that it's easily translatable.
- `project-files`: Any arbitrary files you want to keep with your project **but not publish to the web**, e.g., ai files.
- `src`: **Where the magic happens!** This is where you'll write code for your page.
