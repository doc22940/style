The Graphics Rig is the primary tool for building interactive and graphic pages at Reuters Graphics.

The rig requires **Node version 12.0 or greater** (use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) if you need to manage multiple versions of Node...) and [the Yarn package manager](https://legacy.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).


## Starting a project

##### *If this is your first time*

1. Create a GitHub [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).

2. Add that token as the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` to your machine. (Here's [how on a mac](https://medium.com/@himanshuagarwal1395/setting-up-environment-variables-in-macos-sierra-f5978369b255#6dad)).

3. Install our task [runner](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/runner); our scaffolding engine, [bluprint](https://github.com/reuters-graphics/bluprint), and add the bluprint for the graphics rig to the CLI.

  ```bash
  $ yarn global add @reuters-graphics/runner
  $ yarn global add @reuters-graphics/bluprint
  $ bluprint add reuters-graphics/bluprint_graphics-rig
  ```

##### *Now...*

Make a fresh directory for your new project and use the `graphics rig` bluprint to scaffold out your project.

  ```
  $ mkdir my-new-project
  $ cd my-new-project
  $ bluprint start
  ```


## What's in it?

> - bin/
> - config/
> - **locales/**
> - project-files/
> - **src/**
> - package.json

- `bin/`: Admin scripts that do one-off tasks like resize images and check metadata files.
- `config/`: Admin scripts that configure the page builder. (Mostly [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).)
- `locales/`: ðŸ‘ˆ **Write your content here!**  Folders for each locale. See [Copy and translation](../copy-and-translation/).
- `project-files/`: Any arbitrary files you want to keep with your project but not publish, e.g., ai files.
- `src/`: ðŸ‘ˆ **Write your code here!** See [Writing Code](../writing-code/).
- `package.json`: Contains metadata about the project.

## Developing

The bluprint will install dependencies for you and automatically start a development server. To restart the dev server, use the runner:

```
$ runner start
```


## Building and previewing

1. When you're ready to build your page, the build command will check that you've filled out all the relevant metadata and publish each translation of your page.

  ```
  $ runner build
  ```

2. To preview the built pages for each translation, run the `preview` command which will start a local server that will show you exactly what your page will look like to your readers.

  ```
  $ runner preview
  ```

## Sharing previews

Both the `start` and `preview` commands take an optional `--ngrok` argument that will create a secure (**but public!**) URL you can share with others or use to test your page on a mobile phone. Read more about [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) on their website.

```
$ runner start --ngrok
```

```
$ runner preview --ngrok
```

## Publishing

Projects are published through our [Reuters graphics server](https://editdata.thomsonreuters.com/Pages/graphics.aspx#/rngs/home). Uploading your files to the server is easy:

```
$ runner upload
```

This command will check your metadata files to make sure you have all the information you need on the page, will build out your project files and finally create the graphics pack and individual editions of your project on the server.

Optionally, you can upload a single locale to the server by passing the locale code to the command:

```
$ runner upload de
```
